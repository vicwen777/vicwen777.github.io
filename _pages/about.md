I'm Vic Wen, an undergraduate studentüë®‚Äçüéì from [School of Electronics and Information](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), in collage, my major is [Information Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee_en/2015/0726/c6708a97710/page.htm) and my minor is [Computer Science & Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/2017/0628/c6861a169929/page.htm) My research interest includes Signal Processing, Deep Learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Communication. I like diverse culturesüó∫Ô∏è, multidisciplinaryüéâ and technologyüíª, therefore, I really enjoy making friends with people in different cultural backgroundsüòä. I want to study in graduate school, which made me focus more on a few areas that I was interested in, such as Signal Processingüì∂, Computer Networksüñ•Ô∏è, and Wireless Communicationüõú. At the same time, I hope that the environment of my graduate school will be diverse, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive, and at the same time make friendsüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è from all over the worldüåè and different cultural backgroundsüó∫.

Welcome To My Personal Website!
======
This is a personal website I made based on a template on GitHub Communityüòä, after all, it is simple ,so I ask for your bearing‚ò∫Ô∏è. I update this profile from time to time, upload some of my projectsüóÇÔ∏è, and also share some other content such as vlogsüìΩÔ∏è, postsüì∏, etc, from Instagram and GitHub, which may take some time. So, if you want to follow my news in a timely manner, you can follow my [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/vicwen777) and [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/vicwen777), which is the first place for me to update my information, and welcome you guys to follow meü§ó! I would like to see that I have many followers hahaüòä!

Getting Started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

A Guide of My Website
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

I'm Vic Wen, an undergraduate student👨‍🎓 from [School of Electronics and Information](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), in collage, my major is [Information Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee_en/2015/0726/c6708a97710/page.htm) and my minor is [Computer Science & Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/2017/0628/c6861a169929/page.htm) My research interest includes Signal Processing, Deep Learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Communication. I like diverse cultures🗺️, multidisciplinary🎉 and technology💻, therefore, I really enjoy making friends with people in different cultural backgrounds😊. I want to study in graduate school, which made me focus more on a few areas that I was interested in, such as Signal Processing📶, Computer Networks🖥️, and Wireless Communication🛜. At the same time, I hope that the environment of my graduate school will be diverse, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive, and at the same time make friends🙋‍♂️ from all over the world🌏 and different cultural backgrounds🗺.

Welcome To My Personal Website!
======
This is a personal website I made based on a template on GitHub Community😊, after all, it is simple ,so I ask for your bearing☺️. I update this profile from time to time, upload some of my projects🗂️, and also share some other content such as vlogs📽️, posts📸, etc, from Instagram and GitHub, which may take some time. So, if you want to follow my news in a timely manner, you can follow my [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/vicwen777) and [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/vicwen777), which is the first place for me to update my information, and welcome you guys to follow me🤗! I would like to see that I have many followers haha😊!

A Guide of My Website
======
For a simple guide, my personal website consists of a few components, including publications, talks, posts, teaching, or pages. For example, here is my 📑[Publications](https://vicwen777.github.io/publications/), my 🗂️[Talks](https://vicwen777.github.io/talks), my 🤳[Blogs](https://vicwen777.github.io/year-archive/), my 🪪[CV](https://vicwen777.github.io/cv/), and my 🗺️[Talk Map](https://vicwen777.github.io/talkmap.html) 

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
